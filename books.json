William is a new recruit in the London Metropolitan Police Force, and\nhis father is a distinguished judge. Rather than follow in his father's\nfootsteps, the way his sister has, William has always wanted to be a\ndetective.  \n  \nThis series debut traces William's complicated relationships with his family;\nthe origins of his career; his first mentor, career police officer Fred Yates;\nhis first months on the beat; and his first case as a detective, an\ninvestigation into an art theft ring which has continually outsmarted Scotland\nYard. It also introduces the series villains, ruthless art collector Miles\nFaulkner and his defense attorney, Booth Watson.  \n  \nAs with the Clifton Chronicles, the Warwick novels tell the story of a man, a\nfamily, and an era of our times in the way only Jeffrey Archer can. His\nlegions of fans will be enthralled through each volume, as we follow William's\nlife, through his career, his love life, his family, and the many triumphs and\ntragedies of each.\n\n"}, {"title": "Christmas Shopaholic", "author": "Sophie Kinsella", "genre": "Romance", "isbn": "9781787631977", "numPages": "384", "description": "**Celebrate Christmas with the ultimate Shopaholic!**  \n  \n **The brilliant laugh-out-loud festive novel from the Number One bestselling\nauthor.**  \n  \nBecky Brandon (n\u00e9e Bloomwood) adores Christmas.
