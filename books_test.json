William is a new recruit in the London Metropolitan Police Force, and\nhis father is a distinguished judge. Rather than follow in his father's\nfootsteps, the way his sister has, William has always wanted to be a\ndetective.  \n  \nThis series debut traces William's complicated relationships with his family;\nthe origins of his career; his first mentor, career police officer Fred Yates;\nhis first months on the beat; and his first case as a detective, an\ninvestigation into an art theft ring which has continually outsmarted Scotland\nYard. It also introduces the series villains, ruthless art collector Miles\nFaulkner and his defense attorney, Booth Watson.  \n  \nAs with the Clifton Chronicles, the Warwick novels tell the story of a man, a\nfamily, and an era of our times in the way only Jeffrey Archer can. His\nlegions of fans will be enthralled through each volume, as we follow William's\nlife, through his career, his love life, his family, and the many triumphs and\ntragedies of each.\n\n"

Along the way,\nyou\u2019ll learn the secrets of a Japanese hot-dog-eating champion, the reason an\nAustralian doctor swallowed a batch of dangerous bacteria, and why Nigerian\ne-mail scammers make a point of saying they\u2019re from Nigeria.  \n  \nSome of the steps toward thinking like a Freak:  \n  \nFirst, put away your moral compass\u2014because it\u2019s hard to see a problem clearly\nif you\u2019ve already decided what to do about it.  \nLearn to say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d\u2014for until you can admit what you don\u2019t yet know,\nit\u2019s virtually impossible to learn what you need to.  \nThink like a child\u2014because you\u2019ll come up with better ideas and ask better\nquestions.  \nTake a master class in incentives\u2014because for better or worse, incentives rule\nour world.  \nLearn to persuade people who don\u2019t want to be persuaded\u2014because being right is\nrarely enough to carry the day.  \nLearn to appreciate the upside of quitting\u2014because you can\u2019t solve tomorrow\u2019s\nproblem if you aren\u2019t willing to abandon today\u2019s dud.  \nLevitt and Dubner plainly see the world like no one else. Now you can too.\nNever before have such iconoclastic thinkers been so revealing\u2014and so much fun\nto read.\n\n"

He\nwon a National Award for his debut, became an overnight sensation with his\nfirst film as a leading man (Bobby, 1973), and carved a niche for himself with\na string of romantic musical blockbusters in an era known for its angst-ridden\nfilms. He was the youth icon that is still the toast of the satellite TV\ncircuit. The songs he lip-synced are the bread and butter of all radio\nstations even today. Then there was the second coming after a brief hiatus in\nthe 1990s - as one of the finest actors in mainstream Hindi cinema with\npowerhouse performances in films like Do Dooni Chaar, D-Day, Agneepath and\nothers. Characteristically candid, Rishi Kapoor brings Punjabi brio to the\nwriting of Khullam Khulla. This is as up close and personal a biography as any\nfan could have hoped for. He writes about growing up in the shadow of a\nlegendary father, skipping school to act in Mera Naam Joker, the workings of\nthe musical hits of the era, an encounter with Dawood Ibrahim, his heroines\n(their working relationship, the gossip and the frisson that was sometimes\nreal), his approach to his craft, his tryst with clinical depression, and\nmore.

The stranger claims to be the child of a lost Mughal\nprincess, the youngest sister of Akbar's grandfather Babar: Qara K\u00f6z, 'Lady\nBlack Eyes', a great beauty believed to possess powers of enchantment and\nsorcery, who is taken captive first by an Uzbek warlord, then by the Shah of\nPersia, and finally becomes the lover of a certain Argalia, a Florentine\nsoldier of fortune, commander of the armies of the Ottoman Sultan. When\nArgalia returns home with his Mughal mistress the city is mesmerized by her\npresence, and much trouble ensues.  \n  \n _The Enchantress of Florence_ is the story of a woman attempting to command\nher own destiny in a man's world. It brings together two cities that barely\nknow each other - the hedonistic Mughal capital, in which the brilliant\nemperor wrestles daily with questions of belief, desire and the treachery of\nsons, and the equally sensual Florentine world of powerful courtesans,\nhumanist philosophy and inhuman torture, where Argalia's boyhood friend \"il\nMachia\" - Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli - is learning, the hard way, about the true\nbrutality of power. These two worlds, so far apart, turn out to be uncannily\nalike, and the enchantments of women hold sway over them both.  \n  \nBut is Mogor's story true? And if so, then what happened to the lost princess?\nAnd if he's a liar, must he die?\n\n"

Your advice is\nexcellent. It is not just helpful practically in a job hunt but also has the\nwider use of helping what priorities and directions I have in life. Even in\nsimple financial terms it has repaid my original small investment many times\nover. My thanks for your help.\u201d  \n\u2013Nick Holliman  \n  \nI was let go from the special sales department of Morrow in a reorganization.\nI was only out of work for a few weeks but during that time I went to the\nlocal branch of the public library every day with my brand new copy of What\ncolor is your parachute. I diligently worked my way through the book.\nPhotocopying the work sheets. Filling in the petals of my flowers, listing my\npriorities. Discovering what I was accomplished at, my past successes. It was\nhard not to spend that time working the phone, having lunches. It was hard\nwhen my husband would come home from work and ask what did you do today.\nSomehow I knew that following this guide was important. When I was offered a\njob, I referred back to what I had written, yes, I like to work with women,\nyes, it was a short commute, yes, the new job was about children's books.\nAlthough the new job didn't hit all the points I was confident that it was a\ngood fit. A year later more than one person suggested that I might be happy as\na children's librarian. As I considered this radical life change- public\nservice, graduate school, the unknown, I perused my notebook. This time the\nnew job and my priorities matched perfectly. Working for a non-profit, working\nwith women and children, short commute, life-long learning, independent\nprojects, working with a team, opportunity to grow, no two days alike, working\nwith the public, children's books. Whoa. It is 15 years later and I am still a\nchildren's librarian. I can say I owe my fabulous job as a children's\nlibrarian in a lab school for pre-k to 8th grade, that I teach graduate\nstudents children's literature, that I write about children's books for\nnational magazines, that I haveserved on the Newbery Committee and Notable\nChildren's Books, I owe it all to those days spent in that old Carnegie\nLibrary laboriously filling in the blanks, trusting that something would come\nof those hours of reflection and examination. Yes, What Color Is Your\nParachute changed my life.  \n\u2013Lisa Von Drasek  \n\n"

Mossad: The\nGreatest Missions of the Israeli Secret Service unveils the defi ning and most\ndangerous operations that have shaped Israel and the world at large from the\nagency's more than sixty-year history, among them: the capture of Adolf\nEichmann, the eradication of Black September, the destruction of the Syrian\nnuclear facility, and the elimination of key Iranian nuclear scientists.  \n  \nThrough intensive research and exclusive interviews with Israeli leaders and\nMossad agents, authors Michael Bar-Zohar and Nissim Mishal re-create these\nmissions in riveting detail, vividly bringing to life the heroic operatives\nwho risked everything in the face of unimaginable danger. In the words of\nShimon Peres, president of Israel, this gripping, white-knuckle read \"tells\nwhat should have been known and isn't--that Israel's hidden force is as\nformidable as its recognized physical strength.\"\n\n"

Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a\nwealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed\nby schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by a\nlonging for his mother, he clings to the one thing that reminds him of her: a\nsmall, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into a\nwealthy and insular art community.  \n  \n  \nAs an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the\ndusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in\nlove -- and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.  \n  \n  \n  \n _The Goldfinch_ is a mesmerizing, stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends\ntriumph, an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-\ninvention. From the streets of New York to the dark corners of the art\nunderworld, this \"soaring masterpiece\" examines the devastating impact of\ngrief and the ruthless machinations of fate (Ron Charles, _Washington Post_ ).  \n  \n\n"

Thomas\nKeneally's \"documentary novel,\" based on the recollections of the\nSchindlerjuden (Schindler's Jews), Schindler himself, and other witnesses, is\ntold in a series of snapshot stories. It recounts the lives of the flamboyant\nprofiteer and womanizer Schindler; Schindler's long-suffering wife, Emilie;\nthe brutal SS (Nazi secret service) commandant Amon Goeth; Schindler's quietly\ncourageous factory manager, Itzhak Stern; and dozens of other Jews who\nunderwent the horrors of the Nazi machinery. At the center of the story,\nthough, are the actions and ambitions of Schindler, who comes to Krak\u00f3w,\nPoland, seeking his fortune and ends up outwitting the SS to protect his\nJewish employees. It is the story of Schindler's unlikely heroism and of one\nman's attempt to do good in the midst of outrageous evil. The book explores\nthe complex nature of virtue, the importance of individual human life, the\nrole of witnesses to the Holocaust and the attention to rules and details that\nsustained the Nazi system of terror.\n\n"

In that terrible place, Lale was given the job of tattooing\nthe prisoners marked for survival - literally scratching numbers into his\nfellow victims' arms in indelible ink to create what would become one of the\nmost potent symbols of the Holocaust. Lale used the infinitesimal freedom of\nmovement that this position awarded him to exchange jewels and money taken\nfrom murdered Jews for food to keep others alive. If he had been caught, he\nwould have been killed; many owed him their survival.  \n  \nThere have been many books about the Holocaust - and there will be many more.\nWhat makes this one so memorable is Lale Sokolov's incredible zest for life.\nHe understood exactly what was in store for him and his fellow prisoners, and\nhe was determined to survive - not just to survive but to leave the camp with\nhis dignity and integrity intact, to live his life to the full. Terrible\nthough this story is, it is also a story of hope and of courage. It is also -\nalmost unbelievably - a love story. Waiting in line to be tattooed, terrified\nand shaking, was a young girl. For Lale - a dandy, a jack-the-lad, a bit of a\nchancer - it was love at first sight, and he determined not only to survive\nhimself but to ensure that Gita did, too. His story - their story - will make\nyou weep, but you will also find it uplifting. It shows the very best of\nhumanity in the very worst of circumstances.  \n  \nLike many survivors, Lale and Gita told few people their story after the war.\nThey eventually made their way to Australia, where they raised a son and had a\nsuccessful life. But when Gita died, Lale felt he could no longer carry the\nburden of their past alone. He chose to tell his story. _Publisher's Summary_\n\n"

I simply want to tell\nthe story of my numerous experiments with truth, and as my life consists of\nnothing but those experiments, it is true that the story will take the shape\nof an autobiography.  \n  \n...Identification with everything that lives is impossible without self-\npurification; without self-purification, the observance of the law of Ahimsa\nmust remain an empty dream; God can never be realised by one who is not pure\nof heart. Self-purification, therefore, must remain purification in all walks\nof life. And purification being highly infectious, purification of oneself\nnecessarily leads to the purification of one's surroundings.  \n  \nBut the path to self-purification is hard and steep. To attain perfect purity,\none has to become absolutely passion-free in thought, speech and action; to\nrise above the opposing currents of love and hatred, attachment and repulsion.\nI know that I have not in me as yet the triple purity, in spite of constant\nceaseless striving for it. That is why the world's praise fails to move me;\nindeed it very often stings me. To conquer the subtle passions seems to me far\nharder than the physical conquest of the world by the force of arms. Ever\nsince my return to India, I have had experiences of the dormant passions lying\nhidden within me. The knowledge of them has made me feel humiliated though not\ndefeated. The experiences and experiments have sustained me and given me great\njoy. But I know I still have before me a difficult path to traverse. I must\nreduce myself to zero. So long as a man does not of his own free will put\nhimself last among his fellow creatures, there is no salvation for him. Ahimsa\nis the farthest limit of humility.  \n  \nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi,  \n26 November, 1925.\n\n"

The voice whispers,\nshouts, and sings to us that this experience of being in form, in space and\ntime, knowing life and death, has meaning. The voice is that of inspiration,\nwhich is within each and every one of us. The feelings of emptiness; the idea\nthat there must be something more; wondering, Is this all there is? and trying\nto determine the meaning of life . . . this is all evidence of a yearning to\nreconnect with our soul space. We're aching for our calling to be felt and\nexpressed. In this groundbreaking book, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer explains how we've\nchosen to enter this world of particles and form. From our place of origin, in\nways that we don't readily comprehend now, we knew what we were coming here to\naccomplish, and we participated in setting this life process in motion. So why\nnot think this same way? Why put the responsibility or blame on any one or any\nthing that's not a part of us? On Earth we have the capacity of volition\u2014we\ncan choose\u2014so let's assume that we had the same capacity when we resided in\nthe spiritual realm. We chose our physical body, and we chose the parents we\nneeded for the trip. It doesn't seem too great a stretch to move into the idea\nthat we chose this life in concert with our Source. Each chapter in this book\nis filled with specifics for living an inspired life. From a very personal\nviewpoint, Wayne Dyer offers a blueprint through the world of spirit to\ninspiration, your ultimate calling.\n\n"

The global financial crisis erupted within a week of his assuming\noffice. Then, just as the impact of the crisis on India ebbed, the action\nshifted to combating a decade-high, stubborn inflation during 2009-11, which\nsegued into a battle against a sharp depreciation of the rupee starting\nmid-2012. Who Moved My Interest Rate is an insider\u2019s account of the dilemmas\nand quandaries Subbarao confronted while leading the Reserve Bank through\nthese extraordinary economic and political challenges.  \nSubbarao\u2019s five years at the Reserve Bank also marked an intellectually\nvigorous period for central banking around the world. Not only did the global\nfinancial crisis test the policy force of central banks, but it also raised\nseveral questions about the breadth of their mandates and the limitations of\ntheir autonomy and accountability. While much of the existing debate is set in\nthe advanced economy context, Who Moved My Interest Rate places these issues\nsquarely in an Indian and emerging market perspective. This is also a\ncompelling chronicle of Subbarao\u2019s attempts to demystify the Reserve Bank and\nexplain to the public its impact on their everyday lives.

In the Spring of 2012, he gave a lecture course at Stanford for\nsoftware engineers, calling on them to think boldly and broadly about how they\nmight use their skills to shape the future, and imparting the lessons he has\ngleaned from his own experience. One of the students in that class - Blake\nMasters - took notes and posted them online. The blog posts became a huge\nsuccess, with hundreds of thousands of hits, and became the basis for _Zero to\nOne._  \n  \nWe live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we're too distracted by\nour new mobile devices to notice. Progress has stalled in every industry\nexcept computers, and globalization is hardly the revolution people think it\nis. It's true that the world can get marginally richer by building new copies\nof old inventions, making horizontal progress from '1 to _n'._ But true\ninnovators have nothing to copy. The most valuable companies of the future\nwill make vertical progress from '0 to 1', creating entirely new industries\nand products that have never existed before. _Zero to One_ is about how to\nbuild these companies.  \n  \nA business book that also provides insight into the world of start-ups from a\nSilicon Valley icon, Thiel shows how to pursue your goals using the most\nimportant, most difficult, and most underrated skill in every job or industry:\nthinking for yourself.\n\n"
